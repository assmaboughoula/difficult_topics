[SOUND].

2
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:11,020
This lecture is about link analysis for
web search.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,120
In this lecture we're going to talk
about web search, and particularly

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,420
focusing on how to do link analysis and
use the results to improve search.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,230
The main topic of this lecture is to look
at the ranking algorithms for web search.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,650
In the previous lecture,
we talked about how to create index.

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,550
Now that we have got index,
we want to see how we can improve

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,100
ranking of pages on the web.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,380
Standard IR models can
also be applied here,

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,640
in fact they are important building
blocks for supporting web search,

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,550
but they aren't sufficient,
mainly for the following reasons.

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,540
First, on the web we tend to have
very different information needs.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,240
For example, people might search for
a web page or entry page, and

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,230
this is different from
the traditional library search

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,840
where people are primarily interested
in collecting literature information.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,342
So these kind of queries are often
called navigational queries,

17
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:23,250
the purpose is to navigate into
a particular targeted page.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,230
So for such queries, we might
benefit from using link information.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,370
Secondly, documents have
additional information.

20
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,320
And on the web, web pages are web format.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,100
There are a lot of other groups,

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,536
such as the layout, the title,
or link information again.

23
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:45,030
So this has provided an opportunity to

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,800
use extra context information of
the document to improve scoring.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,240
And finally,
information quality varies a lot.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,410
So that means we have to consider many
factors to improve the ranking algorithm.

27
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,570
This would give us a more robust way to
rank the pages making it the harder for

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,350
any spammer to just manipulate the one
signal to improve the ranking of a page.

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
So as a result people have made
a number of major extensions

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,502
to the ranking algorithms.

31
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:20,380
One line is to exploit links to

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,790
improve scoring and
that's the main topic of this lecture.

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,730
People have also proposed
algorithms to exploit large scale

34
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,440
implicit feedback information
in the form of clickthroughs.

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,850
That's of course in the category
of feedback techniques, and

36
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,730
machinery is often used there.

37
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,406
In general, in web search the ranking
algorithms are based on machinery

38
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:49,640
algorithms to combine
all kinds of features.

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,270
And many of them are based on the standard
original models such as BM25 that

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,152
we talked about, or

41
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:02,845
queried iCode to score
different parts of documents or

42
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:07,380
to, provide additional features
based on content matching.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,250
But link information
is also very useful so

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,660
they provide additional scoring signals.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,080
So let's look at links in
more detail on the web.

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,440
So this is a snapshot of some
part of the web, let's say.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,790
So we can see there are many links
that link different pages together.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,320
And in this case you can also look at the,
the center here.

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,050
There is a description of a link
that's pointing to the document on

50
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,400
the right side.

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,850
Now this description text
is called anchor text.

52
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,900
If you think about this text,
it's actually quite useful

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,855
because it provides some extra description
of that page being pointed to.

54
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:59,695
So, for example, if someone wants
to bookmark Amazon.com front page,

55
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:04,545
the person might say,
the big online bookstore, and

56
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,705
then with a link to Amazon, right?

57
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,885
So the description here is actually very
similar to what the user would type in

58
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,190
in the query box when they are looking for
such a page.

59
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,950
That's why it's very useful for,
for, ranking pages.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,866
Suppose someone types in a query
like online bookstore or

61
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,730
big online bookstore, right.

62
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,960
The query would match this
anchor text in the page here.

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,650
And then this actually
provides evidence for

64
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,650
matching the page that's been pointed to,
that is the Amazon entry page.

65
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,120
So if you match the anchor text
that describes the link to a page,

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,290
actually that provides good evidence for

67
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,080
the relevance of the page
being pointing to.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
So anchor text is very useful.

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,140
If you look at the bottom part of this
picture, you can also see there are some

70
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,380
patterns of links, and these links might
indicate the utility of a document.

71
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,220
So for example,

72
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,280
on the right side you can see this
page has received many in, in links.

73
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,530
That means many other pages
are pointing to this page.

74
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,270
And this shows that this
page is quite useful.

75
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,920
On the left side you can see, this is
a page that points to many other pages.

76
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,050
So, this is a theater page
that would allow you to

77
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,260
actually see a lot of other pages.

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,260
So we can call the first case authority
page and the second case a hub page.

79
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,240
This means the link information
can help in two ways.

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,050
One is to provide extra text for matching.

81
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,050
The other is to provide some
additional scores for the web

82
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,090
pages to characterize how likely a page is
a hub, how likely a page is a authority.

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,610
So people then, of course, propose ideas
to leverage this, this link information.

84
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,290
Google's PageRank,

85
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,200
which was a main technique that they
used in early days, is a good example.

86
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,170
And that, that is the algorithm
to capture page popularity,

87
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,070
basically to score authority.

88
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,680
So the intuitions here are, links are just
like citations in the literature.

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,010
Think about one page
pointing to another page.

90
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,440
This is very similar to one
paper citing another paper.

91
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,360
So, of course,
then if a page is cited often,

92
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,110
then we can assume this page to
be more useful in general, right?

93
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,570
So that's a very good intuition.

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,110
Now, page rank is essentially
to take advantage of this

95
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,650
intuition to implement the,
with the principle approach.

96
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,980
Intuitively it's essentially doing
citation counting or in link counting.

97
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,390
It just improves this simple idea in,
in two ways.

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,420
One is would consider indirect citations.

99
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,960
So that means you don't just look
at the how many in links you have,

100
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,550
you also look at the what are those
pages that are pointing to you.

101
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,530
If those pages, themselves, have a lot
of in links, well that means a lot.

102
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,450
In some sense you will get
some credit from that.

103
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,920
But if those pages that are pointing
to you are not are being pointed to

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,823
by other pages, they themselves don't
have many in links, then, well,

105
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:27,360
you don't get that much credit.

106
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,760
So that's the idea of
getting indirect citation.

107
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,540
Right, so you can also understand
this idea by looking at, again,

108
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,550
the research papers.

109
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,860
If you are cited by, let's say ten papers,
and those ten papers are, just

110
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,450
workshop papers and that, or some papers
that are not very influential, right,

111
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,590
so although you got ten in links,
that's not as good as if you have,

112
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,914
you're cited by ten papers that themselves
have attracted a lot of other citations.

113
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:04,880
So this is a case where

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,570
we would like to consider indirect
links and PageRank does that.

115
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,120
The other idea is,
it's good to smooth the citations.

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,018
Or, or, or
assume that basically every page is

117
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:21,120
having a non-zero pseudo citation count.

118
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,340
Essentially, you are trying to imagine
there are many virtual links that

119
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,390
will link all the pages together so
that you,

120
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,660
you actually get pseudo
citations from everyone.

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,470
The, the reason why they want to
do that is this would allow them

122
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:45,330
to solve the problem elegantly
with linear algebra technique.

123
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,253
So I think maybe the best
way to understand the page

124
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:57,060
rank is through think of
this as through computer,

125
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,129
the probability of a random surfer,
visiting every web page, right.

126
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:13,129
