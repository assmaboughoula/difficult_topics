1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,086
[SOUND].

2
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:12,160
So let's take a look at this in detail.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,935
So in this random surfing model.

4
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:22,565
And any page would assume random surfer
would choose the next page to visit.

5
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,215
So this is a small graph here.

6
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,640
That's, of course an oversimplification
of the complicate it well.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,860
But let's say there
are four documents here.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,280
Right, D1, D2, D3 and D4.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,310
And let's assume that a random surfer or
random walker can be any of these pages.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:49,720
And then the random surfer could decide
to just randomly jump into any page.

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,330
Or follow a link and
then visit the next page.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,520
So if the random server is at d1.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,280
Then, you know, with some probability
that random surfer will follow the links.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,090
Now there two outlinks here.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,700
One is pointing to this D3.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,750
The other is pointing to D4.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,560
So the random surfer could pick any
of these two to reach e3 and d4.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,800
But it also assumes that the random
surfer might, get bored sometimes.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,700
So the random surfer would decide
to ignore the actual links, and

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,356
simply randomly jump to
any page on the web.

21
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:38,950
So, if it does that, eh,
it would be able to reach

22
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,090
any of the other pages even though there
is no link directly from to that page.

23
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,430
So this is the assume the randoms of.

24
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,420
Imagine a random server is
really doing surfing like this,

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,340
then we can ask the question.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,210
How likely on average
the server would actually reach

27
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,040
a particular page d1, or d2, or d3.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,209
That's the average probability
of visiting a particular page.

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,840
And this probability is precisely
what page rank computes.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,990
So the page rank score of the document
is the average probability

31
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,850
that the surfer visits a particular page.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,570
Now, intuitively this will basically
kept you the [INAUDIBLE] link account.

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,220
Why?

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,490
Because if a page has
a lot of in-links then

35
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,470
it would have a higher chance of being
visited, because there will be more

36
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,940
opportunities of having the surfer to
follow a link to come to this page.

37
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,210
And this is why

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,510
the random surfing model actually captures
the idea of counting the in links.

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,030
Note that is also considers
the indirect in links.

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,700
Why?

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,670
Because if the pages that point to you
have themselves a lot of in links,

42
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,210
that would mean the random server
would very likely reach one of them.

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,680
And therefore it increases
the chance of visiting you.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,212
So this is a nice way to capture
both indirect and direct links.

45
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:18,117
So mathematically, how can we compute
this problem enough to see that we need

46
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:22,128
to take a look at how this
problem [INAUDIBLE] in computing.

47
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:25,171
So first let's take a look at
the transition matching sphere.

48
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:29,543
And this is just a matrix with
values indicating how likely a rand,

49
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,470
the random surfer will go
from one page to another.

50
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,230
So each rule stands for a starting page.

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,730
For example,

52
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,760
rule one would indicate the probability
of going to any other four pages from e1.

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,049
And here we see there are only
non two non zero entries.

54
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,290
Each is 1 over 2, a half.

55
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,550
So this is because if you look at
the graph, d1 is pointing to d3 and d4.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,790
There's no link from d1 to d1 server or
d2,

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,285
so we've got 0s for
the first two columns and

58
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,880
0.5 for d3 and d4.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,420
In general, the M in this matrix

60
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,680
M sub i j is the probability
of going from d, i, to d, j.

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,950
And obviously for each rule,
the values should sum to one,

62
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,030
because the surfer will have to go to
precisely one of these other pages.

63
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,720
Right?
So this is a transition matrix.

64
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,690
Now how can we compute the probability
of a server visiting a page?

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Well if you look at the,
the server model, then basically

66
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,270
we can compute the probability
of reaching a page as follows.

67
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,170
So, here on the left-hand side,
you see it's the probability of

68
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,570
visiting page DJ at time t plus 1
because it's the next time cont.

69
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,740
On the right hand side, you can see
the question involves the probability

70
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,000
of, at page ei at time t.

71
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,200
So you can see the subsequent index t,
here.

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,960
And that indicates that's the probability

73
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,480
that the server was at
a document at time t.

74
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,980
So the equation basically captures

75
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,620
the two possibilities of
reaching at d j at time t plus 1.

76
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,510
What are these two possibilities?

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,200
Well one is through random surfing, and

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,930
one is through following
a link as we just explained.

79
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,130
So the first part captures the probability

80
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,670
that the random server would reach
this page by following a link.

81
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,720
And you can see, and
the random surfer chooses this

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,600
strategy was probably
the [INAUDIBLE] as we assumed.

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,920
And so
there is a factor of one minus alpha here.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,510
But the main part is really
sum over all the possible

85
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,545
pages that the server could
have been at time t, right?

86
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:27,462
There were N pages, so
it's a sum over all the possible N pages.

87
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:31,730
Inside the sum is the product
of two probabilities.

88
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:38,200
One is the probability that
the server was at d i at time t.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,050
That's p sub t of d i.

90
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,540
The other is the transition
probability from di to dj.

91
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,355
And so in order to reach this dj page,

92
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:57,880
the surfer must first be at di at time t.

93
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,090
And then also would have to follow
the link to go from di to dj,

94
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,190
so the probability is the probability
of being at di at time t, not divide by

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,329
the probability of, going from that
page to the top of the page dj here.

96
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,890
The second part is a similar sum.

97
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,170
The only difference is that now
the transition probability is uniform,

98
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,830
transition probability.

99
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,690
1 over n.
And this part captures the probability of

100
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,110
reaching this page,
through random jumping.

101
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,510
Right.
So, the form is exactly the same.

102
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,390
And in, in, this also allows us to see

103
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,310
why PageRank essentially assumes
smoothing of the transition matrix.

104
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,070
If you think about this 1 over N as
coming from another transition matrix

105
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:55,320
that has all the elements being 1 over N,
the uniform matrix.

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,650
Then you can see very clearly
essentially we can merge the two parts.

107
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,790
Because they are of the same form,

108
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:07,180
we can imagine there's a difference of
metrics that's a combination of this m and

109
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,500
that uniform matrix where
every element is 1 over n.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,630
In this sense,
page one uses this idea of smoothing and

111
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,240
ensuring that there's no 0,
entry in such a transition matrix.

112
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,530
Of course this is, time depend,
calculation of probabilities.

113
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,490
Now, we can imagine if we want to
compute average probabilities,

114
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,450
the average probabilities probably
would satisfy this equation

115
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,320
without considering the time index.

116
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,770
So let's drop the time index and
just assume that they would be equal.

117
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,280
Now this would give us N equations.

118
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,520
Because for
each page we have such a equation.

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,800
And if you look at the what variables
we have in these equations,

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,650
there are also precisely N variables,
right?

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,220
So this basically means
we now have a system of

122
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,260
n equations with n variables,
and these are linear equations.

123
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,540
So basically, now the problem boils down
to solve this system of equations and

124
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,950
here I also show that
the equations in the metric form.

125
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:29,740
It's the vector P here equals a metrics or
the transports of the metrics here.

126
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,390
And multiply it by the vector again.

127
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,060
Now if you still remember some knowledge
that you learned from linear algebra and

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,468
then you will realize this is precisely
the equation for item vector.

129
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:44,940
Right?
When [INAUDIBLE] metrics by this method

130
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,540
you get the same value as this method.

131
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,290
And this can solved by using
an iterative algorithm.

132
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,940
So is it, because she's here, on the ball,
easily taken from the previous, slide.

133
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:09,170
So you see the, relationship between the,
the page source of different pages.

134
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,737
And in this iterative approach or
power approach

135
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:18,210
we simply start with, randomly the p.

136
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,450
And then we repeatedly just
updated this p by multiplying.

137
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,850
The metrics here by this P-Vector.

138
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,560
So I also show a concrete example here.

139
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,810
So you can see this now, if we assume.

140
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,850
How far is point two.

141
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,860
Then with the example that
we show here on this slide

142
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,650
we have the original
transition metrics here.

143
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,980
Right?
That encodes, that encodes the graph.

144
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,420
The actual links.

145
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,820
And we have this smoothing
transition metrics,

146
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,040
uniform transition metrics,
representing random jumping.

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,950
And we can combine them together with

148
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,320
interpolation to form another
metrics that would be like this.

149
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,780
So essentially we can
imagine now the looks.

150
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,300
Like this can be captured by that.

151
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,970
There are virtual links
between all the pages now.

152
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,070
So the page rank algorithm will
just initialize the p vector first,

153
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,970
and then just computed
the updating of this p vector

154
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,899
by using this, metrics multiplication.

155
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,700
Now if you rewrite this metrics multi,
multiplication

156
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,080
in terms of just a,
an individual equations, you'll see this.

157
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,435
And this is a, basically,
the updating formula for

158
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:54,405
this particular page is a,
page ranking score.

159
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,655
So you can also see, even if you
want to compute the value of this

160
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:01,875
updated score for d1,
you basically multiple this rule.

161
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,670
Right?

162
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,290
By this column, I will take
the total product of the two, right?

163
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,940
And that will give us the value for
this value.

164
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,420
So this is how we updated the vector.

165
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,939
We started with some initial values for
these guys.

166
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,000
For, for this, and then,

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,250
we just revise the scores which
generate a new set of scores.

168
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,550
And the updated formula is this one.

169
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,590
So we just repeatedly apply this,
and here it converges.

170
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,120
And when the metrics is like this.

171
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,510
Where there is no zero values and
it can be guaranteed to converge.

172
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,950
And at that point we will just, have
the PageRank scores for all the pages.

173
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,120
Now we typically set the initial
values just to 1 over n.

174
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,390
So interestingly, this update
formula can be also interpreted as

175
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,900
propagating scores on the graph.

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,500
All right.
Can you see why?

177
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,028
Well if you look at this formula and
then compare that with this graph,

178
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,635
and can you imagine how we
might be able to interpret this

179
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:15,045
as essentially propagating
scores over the graph.

180
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,701
I hope you will see that indeed
we can imagine we have values

181
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,260
initialized on each of these page.

182
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,220
All right, so we can have values here
that say, that's one over four for each.

183
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,170
And then welcome to use these
matrix to update this, the scores.

184
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,280
And if you look at the equation here,

185
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,640
this one, basically we're
going to combine the scores

186
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,890
of the pages that possible would lead to,
reaching this page.

187
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,230
So we'll look at all the pages
that are pointing to this page.

188
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,560
And then combine their scores and

189
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,400
the propagated score,
the sum of the scores to this document D1.

190
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,320
We look after the, the scores
that represented the probability

191
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,410
that the random server would be visiting
the other pages before it reaches the D1.

192
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,770
And then just do the propagation
to simulate the probability

193
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,820
of reaching this, this page D 1.

194
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,910
So there are two interpretations here.

195
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,470
One is just the matrix multiplication.

196
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,900
And we repeated that.

197
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,470
Multiply the vector by this metrics.

198
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,490
The other is to just think of it as
propagating the scores repeatedly

199
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,180
on the web.

200
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,070
So in practice the composition of PageRank
score is actually efficient because

201
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,280
the metrices are sparse and there are some
ways to transform the equation so

202
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,260
you avoid actually literally computing
the values of all of those elements.

203
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,120
Sometimes you may also
normalize the equation, and

204
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,170
that will give you a somewhat
different form of the equation,

205
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,249
but then the ranking of
pages will not change.

206
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,650
The results of this potential
problem of zero out link problem.

207
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,540
In that case if the page does not have
any outlook, then the probability of

208
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,460
these pages will, will not sum to 1.

209
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,180
Basically, the probability of
reaching the next page from this

210
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,740
page will not sum to 1.

211
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,950
Mainly because we have lost some
probability mass when we assume that

212
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,700
there's some probability that
the server will try to follow links but

213
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,160
then there's no link to follow, right?

214
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,250
And one possible solution is simply to
use page specific damping factor and

215
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,270
that, that could easily fix this.

216
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Basically that's to say, how far do we
want from zero for a page with no outlink.

217
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,140
In that case the server would just have to

218
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,370
render them [INAUDIBLE] to another page
instead of trying to follow the link.

219
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,540
So there are many extensions of page rank.

220
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,060
One extension is to do
top-specific page rank.

221
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,250
Note that page rank doesn't really
use the query format machine, right?

222
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,370
So, [INAUDIBLE] so we can make page rank,
appear specific, however.

223
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,870
So, for example,
in the topic specific page rank,

224
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,560
we can simply assume when the surfer,
is bored.

225
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,670
The surfer is not going to randomly
jump into any page on the web.

226
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:32,320
Instead, it's going to jump,
to only those pages that are to a query.

227
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,790
For example, if the query is about sports
then we could assume that when it's

228
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,630
doing random jumping, it's going
to randomly jump to a sports page.

229
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,350
By doing this then we canbuy
a PageRank to topic align with sports.

230
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,490
And then if you know the current query
is about sports then you can use this

231
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,430
specialized PageRank score
to rank the options.

232
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,370
That would be better than if you
use a generic PageRank score.

233
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,370
PageRank is also general algorithm
that can be used in many other.

234
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,839
Locations for network analysis, particular
for example for social networks.

235
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,493
We can imagine if you compute their
PageRank scores for social network,

236
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:13,776
where a link might indicate
friendship relation,

237
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:16,920
you'll get some meaningful scores for
people.

238
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:26,920
