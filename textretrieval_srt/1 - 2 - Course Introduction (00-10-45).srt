2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,898
Text data is very special.

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:16,580
In contrast to the data captured
by machines such as sensors,

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,800
text data is produced by humans.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,630
And they also are meant
to be consumed by humans.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,300
And this has some
interesting consequences.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,158
Because it is produced by humans, it tends
to have a lot of useful knowledge about

8
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:34,250
people's' preferences,
people's' opinions about everything.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,260
And that makes it possible to mine

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,730
text data to discover those
latent prefaces of people,

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,100
which could be very useful to build
an intelligent system to help people.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,210
You can think about
scientific literature or

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,490
so and it's a way to encode
our knowledge about the world.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:00,200
So it's very high quality content, yet we
have difficulty digesting all the content.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,520
Now as a result of the fact that
text is consumed by we humans,

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,270
we also need intelligent software tools
to help people digest the content, or

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,280
otherwise we'd miss
a lot of useful content.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,360
This slide shows that the human really
plays important role in test data mining.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,810
We have to consider human in the loop, and

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,610
we have to consider the fact that
the text is generated by human.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,520
So, here are some examples of
useful text information systems.

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,020
This is by no means a complete
list of all applications.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,030
I categorize them into
different categories.

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,170
But you can probably imagine
other kinds of applications.

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,430
So let's take a look at some of them.

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,720
Search for example,
we all know search engines is special.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Web search engines, iPad,
all of you are using Google, or Bing, or

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,470
another web search engine all the time.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,000
And we also have live research assistants.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,020
And in fact, wherever you have a lot of
text data, you would have a search engine.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,965
So for example, you might have
a search box on your laptop.

32
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,460
All right,
to search content on your computer.

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,380
So that's one kind of application systems,
but

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,170
we also have filtering systems or
recommended systems.

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,433
Those systems can push
information to users.

36
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,470
They can recommend useful
information to users.

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,050
So again, use filters, spam filters.

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,970
Literature the movie recommenders.

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,330
Now not of them are necessary
recommending the information to you.

40
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,800
For example email filter,
spam email filter,

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,600
this is actually to filter out
the spams from your inbox, all right.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,590
But in nature these are similar systems in
that they have to make a binary decision

43
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,700
regarding whether to retain
a particular document or discard it.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,130
Another kind of systems
are categorization systems.

45
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,500
So for example, in handling emails,

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,180
you might prefer automatic,
sorter that would automatically

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,730
sort incoming emails into a proper
folders that you created.

48
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,278
Or we might want to categorize product
reviews into positive or negative.

49
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:11,550
News agencies might be interested in

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,220
categorizing news articles into
all kinds of subject categories.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,180
Those are all categorization systems.

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,180
Finally there are also systems
that might do more analysis.

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,470
And oh, you can say mine text data.

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,020
And these can be text mining systems or

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,500
information extraction systems,
and they can be

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,440
used to analyze text data in more detail
to discover potentially useful knowledge.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,050
For example companies might
be interested in discovering

58
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,500
major complaints from their customers
based on the email messages that the,

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,430
they have received from the customers.

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,590
All right, so
having a system to support that would

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,569
really help improve their productivity and
the customer relations.

62
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:02,975
Also in business, intelligence companies
are often interested in analyzing product

63
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,950
reviews to understand the relative
strengths of their own products

64
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,060
in comparison with competitors.

65
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,205
And, and so these are all examples
of these test mining systems.

66
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:19,820
[INAUDIBLE] we have a lot of data
in particular literature data.

67
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,417
So, there's also great opportunity
of using computer systems

68
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:26,749
to analyze the data to
automatically read literature, and

69
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:30,295
to gain knowledge, and
to help biologists make discoveries.

70
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:32,774
And you can imagine many others.

71
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:35,815
So the point is that with so
much text data,

72
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:41,840
we can build very useful systems to
help people in many different ways.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,490
Now how do we build this systems?

74
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,650
Well these actually are the main
technologies that we'll be talking

75
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,170
about in this course and the other course
that I'm teaching for this specialization.

76
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,930
The main techniques for
building these systems and also for

77
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,530
harnessing the text data are text
retrieval and text data mining.

78
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,180
So I use this picture to show
the relation between these two

79
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,840
some of the different techniques.

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,560
We started with big text data, right?

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,370
But for any applications, we don't
necessarily need to use all the data.

82
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,490
Often we only need the small subset of the
most relevant data, and that's shown here.

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,950
So text retrieval is to convert big,
raw text data into that small

84
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,520
subset of most relevant data that are most
useful for a particular application.

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,320
And this is usually
done by search engines.

86
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,910
And so
this will be covered in this course.

87
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,010
After we have got a small
amount of relevant data,

88
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,640
we also need to further analyze the data
to help people digest the data, or

89
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,040
to turn the data into
actionable knowledge.

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,300
And this step is called text mining,
where we use a number of techniques to

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,920
mine the data to get useful knowledge or
pairings.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,570
And the knowledge can then be used
in many different applications.

93
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,573
And this part, text mining, will be
covered in the other course that I'm

94
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,420
teaching called Text Mining and Analytics.

95
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,470
The emphasis of this course
is on basic concepts and

96
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,480
practical techniques in text retrieval.

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,150
More specifically we will
cover how search engines work.

98
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,340
How to implement a search engine.

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,290
How to evaluate a search engine, so
that you know one search engine is

100
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,350
better than another or
one method is better than another.

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,610
How to improve and
optimize a search engine system.

102
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,640
And how to build a recommender system.

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,300
We also hope to provide a hands on
experience on multiple aspects.

104
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,790
One is to create a test collection for
evaluating search engines.

105
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,240
This is very important for knowing
which technique actually worked well.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,970
And whether your search engine system
is really good for your application.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,920
The other aspect is to experiment
with search engine algorithms.

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,250
In practice, you will have to face
choices of different algorithms.

109
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,090
So it's important to know
how to compare them and

110
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,528
to figure out how they work or
maybe potentially, how to improve them.

111
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:15,190
And finally, we'll provide a platform for
you to do search engine competition.

112
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,010
Where you can compare your different
ideas to see which idea works better

113
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,720
on some data set.

114
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,450
The prerequisites for
this course are minimum.

115
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,650
Basically we hope you have some basic
concepts of computer science, for

116
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,390
example data structures.

117
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,270
And we hope you will be comfortable
with programming, especially in C++.

118
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,780
because that's the language that we'll use
for some of the programming assignments.

119
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,275
The format is lectures plus quizzes,
as often happens in MOOCs.

120
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:49,725
And we also will provide
a program assignments for

121
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:52,255
those of you that have
the resources to do that.

122
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:55,168
We don't really have any required
readings for this course.

123
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:58,650
That just means if you follow all
the lecture videos carefully,

124
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,853
and you're suppose to know all the basic
concepts and the basic techniques.

125
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:06,001
But it's always useful to read more, so

126
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,269
here we provide a list of
some useful reference books.

127
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:16,223
And this in time order, and
that also includes a book that

128
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:19,147
and I are co-authoring now, and

129
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:25,030
we make some draft chapters
available on this website.

130
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,040
And we can find more readings and
reference books on this website.

131
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,260
Finally, and this is the course schedule.

132
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,340
That's just the top of the map for
the rest of the course,

133
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,720
and it shows the topics that we will
cover in the remaining lectures.

134
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,850
This picture also shows basic flow of
information in a text information system.

135
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,170
So starting from the big text data, the
first step is to do some natural language

136
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:57,690
content analysis, because text data is
in the form of natural language text.

137
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,240
So we need to understand
the text to some extent

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,670
in order to do something useful for
the users.

139
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,940
So this is the first
topic that we will cover.

140
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,530
And then on top of that as you
can see there are two boxes here.

141
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,330
Those are two types of systems
that can be used to help people

142
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,140
get access to the most relevant data.

143
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,420
Or in other words, those are the two
kinds of systems that will convert

144
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,800
big text data into small
relevant text data.

145
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,770
Search engines are helping
users to search or

146
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,215
to query the data to get
the most relevant documents out.

147
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:40,310
Recommender systems are to
recommend information to users,

148
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,370
to push information to users.

149
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,830
So those are two, complementary was of

150
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,890
getting users connected to the most
relevant data at the right time.

151
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,640
So this part is called text access,
and this will be the next topic.

152
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,410
And after we cover that we are going
to cover a number of topics,

153
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,285
all about the search engines.

154
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,440
Now the text access
topic is a brief topic,

155
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,180
a brief coverage of
the two kinds of systems.

156
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,470
In the remaining topics, we'll cover
search engines in much more detail.

157
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,120
That includes text retrieval problem,
text retrieval methods, how to evaluate

158
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,570
these methods, implementation of
the system, and web search applications.

159
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,533
And after these, we're going to
go cover the recommender system.

160
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:31,465
So this is what you expect
in the rest of this course.

161
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,928
Thanks.

162
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:42,928
