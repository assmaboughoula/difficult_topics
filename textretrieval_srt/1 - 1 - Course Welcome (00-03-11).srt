Hello

2
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:12,312
welcome to the course in
Text Retrieval and Search Engines.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,984
I'm Cheng Xiang Zhai.

4
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:16,430
I have a nickname Cheng.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm a professor of the Department
of Computer Science at

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,964
the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,080
this first lecture is a basic
introduction to the course.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,580
A brief introduction to what
we we'll cover in the course.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,810
We're going to first talk about the data
mining specialization since this course is

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,280
part of that specialization.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,390
And then we'll cover motivation
objectives of the course.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,020
This will be followed by pre-requisites
and course format and reference books.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,160
And then finally we'll talk
about the course schedule,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,419
which has number of topics to be
covered in the rest of this course.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,110
So the data mining specialization
offered by the University of Illinois

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,080
at Urbana-Champaign is really to address
the need for data mining techniques to

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
handle a lot of big data,
to turn the big data into knowledge.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,270
There are five lecture-based courses,
as you see on the slide.

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,250
Plus one capstone,
project course in the end.

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,190
I'm teaching two of them which is
this course, Text Retrieval and

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,910
Search Engines and this one.

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,850
So the two courses that I cover
here are all about the text data.

23
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:35,827
In contrast, the other courses are
covering more general techniques that can

24
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:38,470
be applied to all kinds of data.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,635
So Patent Discovery taught by the
Professor Jowi Han and Cluster Analysis

26
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:49,480
again taught by him about the general data
mining techniques to handle structure.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,330
The end and structure text data.

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,229
And data mine, data visualization
covered by professor Jung Hart is about

29
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,290
the general visualization techniques.

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,080
Again applicable to all kinds of data.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,100
So the motivation for this course.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,760
In fact also for

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,210
the other courses that I'm teaching
is that we have a lot of text data.

34
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,130
And the data is everywhere,
is growing rapidly, so

35
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,240
you must have been
experiencing this growth.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Just think about how much text data
you're dealing with every day.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,610
I listed some data types here, for

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,710
example, on the internet we see a lot
of web pages, news articles etcetera.

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,084
And then we have block articles,

40
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:37,450
emails, scientific literature,
tweets, as well speaking,

41
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,070
maybe a lot of tweets are being written,
and a lot of emails are, are being sent.

42
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,483
So, the amount of text data is beyond
our capacity to understand them.

43
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:52,963
Also, the amount of data makes it possible
to actually analyze the data to discover

44
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:57,585
interesting knowledge and that's what
we meant by, harnessing big text data.

45
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:07,585
