1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,030
[SOUND] So
we talked about a page rank as a way to

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,045
to capture the Authorities.

3
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:21,245
Now we also looked at the, some other
examples where a hub might be interesting.

4
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,982
So, there is another
algorithm called the HITS and

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,417
that's going to do compute the scores for
us.

6
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:28,142
Authorities & Hubs.

7
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:32,467
Intuitions of,
pages that are widely cited, good, sorry,

8
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,567
there is, then,
there is pages that are cited.

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,947
Many other pages are good Hubs, right?

10
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:40,430
But there, I think that the.

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,710
Most interesting idea of this
algorithm HITS is, it's going to use,

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,520
a reinforcement mechanism to kind of
help improve the scoring for

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,466
Hubs and the Authorities.

14
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,170
And here, so here's the idea,

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,809
it will assume that good
authorities are cited by good hubs.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,210
That means if you're cited by
many pages with good hub scores,

17
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,550
then that increases your authority score.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,740
And similarly, good hubs are those
that pointed to good authorities.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,590
So if you get you point it to
a lot of good authority pages,

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,880
then your hub score would be increased.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,570
So you then, you would have
iterative reinforce each other,

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,120
because you can point
it to some good hubs.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,480
Sorry, you can point it
to some good authorities.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,860
To get a good hub score.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,300
Whereas those authority scores,
would be also improved,

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,958
because they are pointed to by a good hub.

27
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:38,922
And this hub is also general,
it can have many applications in graph and

28
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,740
network analysis.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,190
So just briefly, here's how it works.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,020
We first also construct the matrix, but

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,010
this time we're going to
construct the Adjacency matrix.

32
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,670
We're not going to normalize the values,
so if there's a link there's a y.

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,055
If there's no link that's zero.

34
00:01:54,055 --> 00:02:01,039
Right again, it's the same graph and then,
we're going to define the top score of

35
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,965
page as a sum of the authority scores
of all the pages that it appoints to.

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,670
So whether you are hub that really depends
on whether you are pointing to a lot of,

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,440
good authority pages.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,070
That's what it says in the first equation.

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,130
Your second equation,
will define the authority score of a page

40
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,730
as a sum of the hub scores
of all those pages.

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,690
That they point to, so whether you
are a good authority would depend on

42
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,420
whether those pages that
are pointing to you are good Hubs.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,390
So you can see this a forms
a iterative reinforcement mechanism.

44
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,690
Now these two equations
can be also written.

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,600
In the matrix fo-, format.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,365
Right, so
what we get here is then the hub vector is

47
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:54,070
equal to the product of
the Adjacency matrix.

48
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,020
And the authority vector.

49
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,480
And this is basically the first equation.

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,428
Right.

51
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:05,430
And similarly, the second equation can
be returned as the authority vector

52
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,190
is equal to the product of A transpose
multiplied by the hub vector.

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,830
And these are just different ways
of expressing these equations.

54
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,410
But what's interesting is that if
you look at to the matrix form.

55
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,670
You can also plug-in the authority
equation into the first one.

56
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,580
So if you do that, you can actually
make it limited to the authority vector

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,920
completely, and
you get the equation of only hub scores.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Right, the hub score vector is equal
to A multiplied by A transpose.

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,210
Multiplied by the hub score vector again.

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,530
And similarly we can do
a transformation to have equation for

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,430
just the authorities scores.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,370
So although we framed the problem
as computing Hubs & Authorities,

63
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,500
we can actually eliminate the one of them
to obtain equation just for one of them.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,410
Now the difference between this and
page is that, now the matrix

65
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,842
is actually a multiplication of the mer-,
Adjacency matrix and its transpose.

66
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,730
So this is different from page rank.

67
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,260
Right?

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,660
But mathematically then we would
be computing the same problem.

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,320
So in ha, in hits,

70
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,210
we're keeping would initialize the values
that state one for all these values.

71
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,852
And then with the algorithm will apply
these, these equations essentially and

72
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:29,390
this is equivalent if you multiply that.

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,670
By, by the matrix.

74
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,980
A and A transpose.

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,570
Right.

76
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,740
And so the arrows of these are exactly
the same in the debate rank.

77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,700
But here, because the Adjacency matrix
is not normalized, so what we have to do

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,880
is to, what we have to do is after each
iteration we have to do normalize.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,980
And this would allow us to
control the grooves of value.

80
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,980
Otherwise they would,
grew larger and larger.

81
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,450
And if we do that, and
then we will basically get a, HITS.

82
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,210
I was in the computer, the hub scores and
also the scores for all of the pages.

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,637
And these scores can then be used,
in ranging to start the PageRank scores.

84
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,770
So to summarize, in this lecture we have
seen that link information is very useful.

85
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,000
In particular,
the Anchor text base is very useful.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,900
To increase the the text
representation of a page.

87
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,750
And we also talk about the PageRank and

88
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,370
HITS algorithm as two major
link analysis algorithms.

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,440
Both can generate scores for.

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,960
What pages that can be used for
the, the ranking function.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,238
Those that PageRank and
the HITS also very general algorithms, so

92
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:46,716
they have many applications in
analyzing other graphs or networks.

93
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:56,716
