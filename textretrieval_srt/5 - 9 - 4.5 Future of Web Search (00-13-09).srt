1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,047
[SOUND].

2
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:10,080
This lecture is about
the future of web search.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,560
In this lecture, we're going to talk
about some possible future trends

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,489
of web search and intelligent information
retrieval systems in general.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,561
In order to further improve
the accuracy of a search engine,

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,752
it's important that to consider
special cases of information need.

7
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:39,056
So one particular trend could be to
have more and more specialized than

8
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:44,630
customized search engines, and they
can be called vertical search engines.

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,180
These vertical search engines can be
expected to be more effective than

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,940
the current general search engines
because they could assume that

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,070
users are a special group of users that
might have a common information need,

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,420
and then the search engine can be
customized with this ser, so, such users.

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,150
And because of the customization,
it's also possible to do personalization.

14
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,360
So the search can be personalized,

15
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,190
because we have a better
understanding of the users.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,550
Because of the restrictions with domain,
we also have some advantages

17
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,590
in handling the documents, because we can
have better understanding of documents.

18
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,880
For example, particular words may
not be ambiguous in such a domain.

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,750
So we can bypass the problem of ambiguity.

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,460
Another trend we can expect to see,

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,600
is the search engine will
be able to learn over time.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,430
It's like a lifetime learning or
lifelong learning, and this is, of course,

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,800
very attractive because that means the
search engine will self-improve itself.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,780
As more people are using it, the search
engine will become better and better, and

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,260
this is already happening,

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,980
because the search engines can learn
from the [INAUDIBLE] of feedback.

27
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,800
More users use it, and the quality
of the search engine allows for

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,840
the popular queries that are typed in by
many users allow it to become better,

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,110
so this is sort of another
feature that we will see.

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,600
The third trend might be
to the integration of

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,190
bottles of information access.

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,050
So search, navigation, and
recommendation or filtering might be

33
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,480
combined to form a full-fledged
information management system.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,470
And in the beginning of this course,
we talked about push versus pull.

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,100
These are different modes of information
access, but these modes can be combined.

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,660
And similarly, in the pull mode, querying
and the browsing could also be combined.

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,390
And in fact we're doing that basically,
today, is the [INAUDIBLE] search endings.

38
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,000
We are querying, sometimes browsing,
clicking on links.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
Sometimes we've got some
information recommended.

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,466
Although most of the cases the information
recommended is because of advertising.

41
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:16,305
But in the future, you can imagine
seamlessly integrate the system with

42
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:21,380
multi-mode for information access, and
that would be convenient for people.

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Another trend is that we might see systems

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,970
that try to go beyond the searches
to support the user tasks.

45
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,730
After all, the reason why people want
to search is to solve a problem or

46
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,690
to make a decision or perform a task.

47
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,380
For example consumers might search for

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,385
opinions about products in
order to purchase a product,

49
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:50,160
choose a good product by, so
in this case it would be beneficial to

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,330
support the whole workflow of purchasing
a product, or choosing a product.

51
00:03:56,732 --> 00:04:00,300
In this era, after the common search
engines already provide a good support.

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,190
For example, you can sometimes look at the
reviews, and then if you want to buy it,

53
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,040
you can just click on the button to go the
shopping site and directly get it done.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
But it does not provide a,
a good task support for many other tasks.

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,720
For example, for researchers,

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,800
you might want to find the realm in
the literature or site of the literature.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:26,550
And then, there's no, not much support for
finishing a task such as writing a paper.

58
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,130
So, in general, I think,
there are many opportunities in the wait.

59
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,980
So in the following few slides, I'll
be talking a little bit more about some

60
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,900
specific ideas or thoughts that hopefully,

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,720
can help you in imagining new
application possibilities.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,330
Some of them might be already relevant
to what you are currently working on.

63
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,370
In general, we can think about any
intelligent system, especially intelligent

64
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:02,390
information system, as we specified
by these these three nodes.

65
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,680
And so
if we connect these three into a triangle,

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,250
then we'll able to specify
an information system.

67
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,480
And I call this
Data-User-Service Triangle.

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,110
So basically the three questions you
ask would be who are you serving and

69
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,470
what kind of data are you are managing and
what kind of service you provide.

70
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,360
Right there, this would help us
basically specify in your system.

71
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,400
And there are many different ways
to connect them depending on

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,040
how you connect them,
you will have a different kind of systems.

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,650
So let me give you some examples.

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,470
On the top,
you can see different kinds of users.

75
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,250
On the left side, you can see different
types of data or information, and

76
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,740
on the bottom,
you can see different service functions.

77
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,760
Now imagine you can connect
all these in different ways.

78
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,990
So, for example, you can connect
everyone with web pages, and

79
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,140
the support search and
browsing, what do you get?

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,050
Well, that's web search, right?

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,680
What if we connect UIUC employees with
organization documents or enterprise

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,720
documents to support the search and
browsing, but that's enterprise search.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,110
If you connect the scientist
with literature information

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,050
to provide all kinds of service,
including search, browsing, or

85
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,310
alert of new random documents or
mining analyzing research trends,

86
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,490
or provide the task with support or
decision support.

87
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,600
For example, we might be,
might be able to provide a support for

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,140
automatically generating
related work section for

89
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,440
a research paper, and
this would be closer to task support.

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,270
Right?
So then

91
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,010
we can imagine this would
be a literature assistant.

92
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,800
If we connect the online shoppers
with blog articles or product reviews

93
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,825
then we can help these people
to improve shopping experience.

94
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:05,465
So we can provide, for example data mining
capabilities to analyze the reviews,

95
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:11,950
to compare products, compare sentiment of
products and to provide task support or

96
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,950
decision support to have them
choose what product to buy.

97
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,510
Or we can connect customer service
people with emails from the customers,

98
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,660
and, and we can imagine a system
that can provide a analysis

99
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,460
of these emails to find that the major
complaints of the customers.

100
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,150
We can imagine a system we
could provide task support

101
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,630
by automatically generating
a response to a customer email.

102
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,720
Maybe intelligently attach
also a promotion message

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,830
if appropriate, if they detect that that's
a positive message, not a complaint, and

104
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,290
then you might take this opportunity
to attach some promotion information.

105
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,770
Whereas if it's a complaint,
then you might be able to

106
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,810
automatically generate some
generic response first and

107
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,790
tell the customer that he or she can
expect a detailed response later, etc.

108
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,210
All of these are trying to help
people to improve the productivity.

109
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,850
So this shows that
the opportunities are really a lot.

110
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,090
It's just only restricted
by our imagination.

111
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,400
So this picture shows the trend
of the technology, and also,

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,770
it characterizes the, intelligent
information system in three angles.

113
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,065
You can see in the center, there's
a triangle that connects keyword queries

114
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,225
to search a bag of words representation.

115
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:46,721
That means the current search engines
basically provides search support

116
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:54,085
to users and mostly model
users based on keyword queries

117
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:59,105
and sees the data through
bag of words representation.

118
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:06,190
So it's a very simple approximation of
the actual information in the documents.

119
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,500
But that's what the current system does.

120
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,150
It connects these three nodes
in such a simple way, or

121
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,655
it only provides a basic search function
and doesn't really understand the user,

122
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:24,405
and it doesn't really understand that
much information in the documents.

123
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:31,862
Now, I showed some trends to push each
node toward a more advanced function.

124
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,332
So think about the user node here, right?

125
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:39,432
So we can go beyond the keyword queries,
look at the user search history,

126
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:43,882
and then further model the user
completely to understand the,

127
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:49,622
the user's task environment,
task need context or other information.

128
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:55,120
Okay, so this is pushing for
personalization and complete user model.

129
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,630
And this is a major
direction in research in,

130
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,810
in order to build intelligent
information systems.

131
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,810
On the document side,
we can also see, we can

132
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,640
go beyond bag of words implementation
to have entity relation representation.

133
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,040
This means we'll recognize people's names,
their relations, locations, etc.

134
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,430
And this is already feasible with
today's natural processing technique.

135
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,130
And Google is the reason
the initiative on the knowledge graph.

136
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,310
If you haven't heard of it,
it is a good step toward this direction.

137
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,820
And once we can get to that level without
initiating robust manner at larger scale,

138
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,170
it can enable the search engine
to provide a much better service.

139
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,470
In the future we would like to have

140
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,450
knowledge representation where we
can add perhaps inference rules, and

141
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,750
then the search engine would
become more intelligent.

142
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,490
So this calls for
large-scale semantic analysis, and

143
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,150
perhaps this is more feasible for
vertical search engines.

144
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,800
It's easier to make progress
in the particular domain.

145
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
Now on the service side,

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,920
we see we need to go beyond the search of
support information access in general.

147
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,702
So search is only one way to get access
to information as well recommender

148
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:19,980
systems and push and pull so different
ways to get access to random information.

149
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,630
But going beyond access,

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,820
we also need to help people digest the
information once the information is found,

151
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,560
and this step has to do with analysis
of information or data mining.

152
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,540
We have to find patterns or
convert the text information into

153
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,865
real knowledge that can
be used in application or

154
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,055
actionable knowledge that can be used for
decision making.

155
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:47,165
And furthermore the knowledge
will be used to help a user to

156
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:52,580
improve productivity in finishing a task,
for example, a decision-making task.

157
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,000
Right, so this is a trend.

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,370
And, and, and so basically,
in this dimension, we anticipate

159
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,210
in the future intelligent information
systems will provide intelligent and

160
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,940
interactive task support.

161
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,200
Now I should also emphasize interactive
here, because it's important to optimize

162
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,790
the combined intelligence of the users and
the system.

163
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,140
So we, we can get some help
from users in some natural way.

164
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,970
And we don't have to assume the system
has to do everything when the human,

165
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,290
user, and the machine can collaborate in
an intelligent way, an efficient way,

166
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,270
then the combined intelligence
will be high and in general,

167
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,010
we can minimize the user's overall
effort in solving problem.

168
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,947
So this is the big picture of future
intelligent information systems,

169
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:52,582
and this hopefully can provide
us with some insights about

170
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:57,313
how to make further innovations
on top of what we handled today.
